    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This manual provides instructions for playing Tetris, a classic puzzle game.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section">
    <h3>Gameplay</h3>
    <p>Tetris is played on a grid-based board. Blocks of various shapes, called tetrominoes, fall from the top of the
      board. The player must rotate and move the falling tetrominoes to create complete rows of blocks without any gaps.
      When a row is complete, it disappears, and a new random block above it moves down to fill the space.</p>
    <p>The game ends when the stack of tetrominoes reaches the top of the board, making it impossible to place new
      pieces.</p>

    <h3>Scoring</h3>
    <p>The player earns points for each row that is completed. The more rows completed simultaneously, the higher the
      score.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If the player completes 1 row the score goes up to 100 points.</li>
      <li>If the player completes 2 rows the score goes up to 300 points.</li>
      <li>If the player completes 3 rows the score goes up to 700 points.</li>
      <li>If the player completes 4 rows the score goes up to 1500 points.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each 600 points of the score will increase the speed of the game by 1 level starting with level 1 and going up to
      10 level.</p>
